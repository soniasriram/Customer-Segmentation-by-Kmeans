# Mini Project Notebook: Customer segmentation using clustering


# Learning Objectives
At the end of the experiment, you will be able to :

1. extract summary level insight from a given customer dataset.
2. handle the missing data and identify the underlying pattern or structure of the data.
3. create an unsupervised model that generates the optimum number of segments for the customer base
4. identify customer segments based on the overall buying behaviour

# Dataset

The dataset chosen for this mini project is the Online Retail dataset. It is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

**The dataset contains 541909 records, and each record is made up of 8 fields.**

#Information

Clustering is the task of grouping together a set of objects so that the objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to objects in other clusters. Similarity is a measure that reflects the strength of the relationship between two data objects.

In the clustering calculation, K-Means is a very popular algorithm. In this analysis, this method is used to cluster the similar data items.

In Retail and E-Commerce (B2C), and more broadly in B2B, one of the key elements shaping the business strategy of a firm is understanding of customer behaviour. More specifically, understanding the customers based on different business metrics: how much they spend (revenue), how often they spend (frequency), are they new or existing customers, what are their favorite products, etc... Such understanding in turn helps direct marketing, sales, account management and product teams to support customers on a personalized level and improve the product offering.

Furthermore, segmenting customers into different categories based on similar/cyclical buying pattern over a period of 1 year helps the retail shops manage their inventory better, thereby lowering costs and raising revenues by placing the orders in sync with the buying cycles.

# Problem Statement
Perform customer segmentation for an Online Retail using an Unsupervised Clustering technique (K-Means)
